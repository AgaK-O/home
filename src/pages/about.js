      <p>Frontend developer with an extensive experience in creating and maintaining beautiful and functional
        UI components. Having a solid base as an UI developer I very much enjoy getting deeper into
        JavaScript side of projects, getting to know what makes them tick and improving them.</p>
      <p>I feel strongly about the structure of projects and keeping things organized and easy to follow.
        Iâ€™m task-oriented, active in meetings with insightful input, strive to maintain good relations with team
        members.</p>
      <p>Coming from social and culture science I am a great asset for any team bringing out of the box thinking
        and the ability to look at any problem from different perspectives.</p>
